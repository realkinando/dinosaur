a rEvoLuTioN iN bAnKIng, it's an ERC20 token, but only works 9 to 5, like your favourite bank ;)... This is a joke token

This contract uses block.timestamp to determine what time of day it is

Transfers revert outside of opening hours. 

Also got it to take 2 days off. Cos it's hard work being a generic ERC20 token
